# Spreading the word! Direct and spillover effects of a social comparison campaign on water conservation.

Field experiments using normative information have proven effective in promoting pro-environmental behaviors. However, the presence of spillover eﬀects has produced biased or lower-bound estimators. This paper reports the results of a randomized ﬁeld experiment that produces and measures spillover effects in residential water conservation. I use a multilevel design, randomly assigning the treatment to households conditional to diﬀerent percentages within villages. I ﬁnd that accounting for spillovers leads to higher eﬀects than previous interventions. On average, directly exposed households reduce water consumption by 7.5% and spillovers by 4.5%.
Regarding mechanisms, proximity to directly treated households in the same street reinforces the eﬀects of the directly treated. Overall, the reactions of the households could be explained by communication with other family members and interaction in public places. Trust in neighbors and local institutions seems to drive the response in spillover. My results emphasize the importance of spillovers in informational interventions. Using them accurately could help to diﬀuse desirable or avert destructive behaviors in environmental concerns at a lower cost.
