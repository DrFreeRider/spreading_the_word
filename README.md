# Spreading the word! Direct and spillover effects of a social comparison campaign on water conservation.

Field experiments using normative information have proven eﬀective in promoting pro-environmental behaviors. However, the presence of spillover eﬀects has produced biased or lower-bound estimators. This paper reports the results of a randomized ﬁeld experiment that produces and measures spillover eﬀects in residential water conservation. I use a multilevel design that randomly assigns the treatment to households conditional to diﬀerent percentages within villages. I ﬁnd that accounting for spillovers leads to higher eﬀects than in previous interventions. On average, directly exposed households reduce water consumption by 7.5% and spillovers by 4.5%. In terms of mechanisms, proximity to directly treated households in the same street reinforce the eﬀects on the directly treated. Overall, the reactions of the households could be explained by communication with other family members and interaction in public places. In spillover, trust in neighbors and local institutions seems to drive the response. My results remark the importance of spillovers in informational interventions. The use of them accurately could help to diﬀuse desirable or to avert bad behaviors in environmental concerns at a lower cost.
